Wizards & Magic: A Quest Through Time
==============

Large Game Project at Blekinge Institute of Technology. A group of 15 people working together to make the greatest Doom/Magicka hybrid ever. Took about 4 months of actual worktime, considering breaks and such. Designed to with low ram and on computers without dedicated graphics cards, which is why nothing is high definition and has various limitations to lighting. Uses Opengl.

To test the game just go to releases and download the zip. Might need to install some runtime, like .net, to run.
